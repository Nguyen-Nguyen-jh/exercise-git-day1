### why we create separate branches for features

1. Isolate code (Tách biệt mã nguồn): When you create a separate branch for a feature, you can work on that feature without affecting the main codebase (e.g., the main or production branch). This helps prevent unwanted conflicts or errors from occurring during the development of other features.

2. Reduce conflicts between features: When multiple people are working on the same project, each person can develop their own feature independently without disrupting the work of others. This helps reduce source code conflicts when the features are merged later on.

3. Easier management and control of features: Creating a separate branch allows you to easily manage and control new features since you can work and test them on that branch without affecting the main branch

4. Manage pull requests: Once a feature is complete and tested, you can easily create a pull request (PR) from the feature branch into the main branch (like main or develop) for review and merging. This makes the code review process more transparent and manageable
